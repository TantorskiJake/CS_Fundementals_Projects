# CS Fundamentals Projects

Welcome to the CS Fundamentals Projects repository! This collection is designed to help you explore and reinforce key concepts in computer science, programming, and web development. Each directory corresponds to a weekly project, offering hands-on experience and practical application of the topics covered in a structured learning plan.

## Project Structure

1. **Introduction to Computer Science:** Explore the history of computer science and its pivotal milestones.

2. **Programming Fundamentals:** Dive into the basics of coding with a simple program.

3. **Data Types, Variables, and Operators:** Manipulate different data types, variables, and operators.

4. **Control Flow and Decision Structures:** Build a program incorporating if statements and loops.

5. **Functions and Modular Programming:** Develop a well-organized program with distinct functions.

6. **Data Structures - Arrays and Lists:** Implement a program utilizing arrays or lists to manage and manipulate data.

7. **Data Structures - Stacks and Queues:** Create a simulation or application that demonstrates the use of stacks or queues.

8. **Object-Oriented Programming Concepts:** Design a simple system using classes and objects to represent real-world entities.

9. **Classes and Objects:** Extend the previous project by adding more classes and refining the object interactions.

10. **File Handling and Input/Output:** Develop a program that reads data from a file, processes it, and writes the results back to another file.

11. **Algorithm Design and Analysis:** Implement a basic algorithm, analyze its time complexity, and compare it with alternative approaches.

12. **Searching and Sorting Algorithms:** Create a program that uses different searching and sorting algorithms and compare their performance.

13. **Databases and SQL:** Build a simple database-driven application using SQL to manage and query data.

14. **Web Development Basics - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** Construct a basic webpage with interactive elements using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

15. **Introduction to Software Development Life Cycle:** Outline a software development plan for a hypothetical project, including stages and milestones.

16. **Final Project and Review:** Combine learned concepts into a comprehensive final project, demonstrating proficiency in various aspects of programming and computer science.
